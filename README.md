# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Credit Risk analysis
### For this analysis, we are using imbalanced learn and scikit learn libraries to help us build models to help us determine resampling methods.  We also compared the multiple machine learning methods to minimize bias as well as use different classifiers. 

## Results
### Naive Random Oversampling

## Summary 
### I attempted multiple combinations of sample types to help come to a conclusion on predicting which loans are at the highest risk.  Those scores were not very high compared to ensemble classifiers.  The easy ensemble had the overall best balance of the models we used in this challenge.
